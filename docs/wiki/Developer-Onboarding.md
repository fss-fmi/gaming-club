# Developer Onboarding

This manual should serve you as a starting point for contributing to the SUGAMING platform. It showcases the general project structure, tools, and steps for setting up a local development environment, etc. Whether you are a seasoned developer of the platform or you are just poking around the codebase - your contributions are welcomed and appreciated! üíñ

## üîé Project Overview

The project consists of 3 main components:

- `sugaming-api`, for handling data access, user login, tournament, and match creation, game server creation, etc. (located in [apps/sugaming-api](../blob/main/apps/sugaming-api))
- `sugaming-site`, for user interaction with the platform (located in [apps/sugaming-site](../blob/main/apps/sugaming-site))
- `sugaming-admin`, for administering tournaments, matches and platform users (located in [apps/sugaming-admin](../blob/main/apps/sugaming-admin))

## ‚öô Environment Variables

If you want to run the project locally you will be required to set environment variables such as database connection strings, API keys, etc. A template containing all the environment variables needed to be set is available in [.env.template](../blob/main/.env.template).

In addition, apps in the mono-repo may have additional environment variables, applicable exclusively to them. Templates for such variables can be found in `apps/<application name>/.env.template`. Please note that if such a file does not exist, that simply means the application does not require any additional configuration apart from the common between all packages.

If you are a part of the project development team, you can refer to [this secret store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo) for complete configurations.

## üî® Tools Required

## üë®‚Äçüíª Project Development Setup

To setup the project for local development, complete the following steps:

1. Clone the project git repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/fss-fmi/sugaming
```

2. Install project dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

3. Start project applications locally.
   To start a specific application, run the following command:

```
yarn nx serve <application name>
```

If you wish to start all the mono-repo projects, run the following command:

```
yarn nx run-many -t serve --all
```
