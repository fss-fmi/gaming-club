# From a Task to a Feature - Workflow Description

This manual should walk you through the entire process of creating a task (issue), working on it, submitting a pull request, merging and deploying it. The guide will also outline several conventions that you should stick to in the process.

## Issues

Issues are a feature of GitHub that allows tracking, discussion, and prioritization of tasks, features, bug fixes, and other issues related to software projects. In this project it is used for task tracking, work assignment and team communication.

To view all the open issues for SUGAMING - [go to this page](https://github.com/fss-fmi/sugaming/issues).

To create an issue, select the `New issues` button and choose an appropriate template to the task you are assigning. In case you need to modify the issue templates, they are stored as markdown files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.

Whenever creating an issue, make sure to stick to the template and give as much context as you currently have. Also, ensure that you have assigned the appropriate labels, project, milestone and assignee(s) in the right-side panel. It's not a problem if a request doesn't initially have an assignee - it can be assigned later.

An open issue is considered as a task to be completed - so whenever a task is completed, make sure to close the issue, wether that will be via a comment or a [pull request](#pull-requests-prs).
